We focus on the development and optimization of the robot's walking algorithms, vision systems, and decision-making processes. By building a complete simulation test system and formulating systematic training protocols, we aim to achieve basic stability, positioning accuracy, and multi-robot cooperative capabilities for the upcoming competition.
